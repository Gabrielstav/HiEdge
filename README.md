# HiEdge

## Overview

HiEdge is a pipeline used to generate networks in edge list format from Hi-C Pro's Hi-C data. It works with both raw and balanced matrices, at any resolution. The pipeline runs in parallel and enables processing of multiple resolutions and cell line datasets simultaneously. The end result are networks containing only significant chromatin contacts. See "Usage" and help message for more information.
