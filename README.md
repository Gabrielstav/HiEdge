# HiEdge

## Overview

HiEdge is a pipeline used to generate networks in edge list format from Hi-C Pro's Hi-C data. It works with both raw and balanced matrices, at any resolution. The pipeline runs in parallel and enables processing of multiple resolutions and cell line datasets simultaneously. The end result are networks containing only significant chromatin contacts. See "Usage" and help message for more information.


HiEdge is a Hi-C pipeline used to easily and automatically process output data from Hi-C Pro to significant interactions. All you need to do it provide the input directory containing the Hi-C data, and the pipeline does the rest.
