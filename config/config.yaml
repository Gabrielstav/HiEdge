  # Reference genome
  refernce_genome: "hg19" # Reference genome used in hic pro (hg19 or hg38)

  # Hi-C Pro file discovery settings
  hicpro_raw_dirname: "raw" # Directory containing raw HiC-Pro matrix output
  hicpro_norm_dirname: "iced" # Directory containing balanced HiC-Pro matrix output and bias matrices

  # Determine types of chromatin interactions to consider
  # Only one of these should be set to True at a time
  inter: False  # Inter- and intrachromosomal interactions
  intra: True   # Intrachromosomal interactions only
  mixed: False  # Mixed type of interactions (separate statistical testing for inter and intra)

  # Execution settings
  threads: 8  # Number of threads to use
  executor: "multiprocessing"  # Execution mode: "multiprocessing" or "threading"
  no_split: False  # If true, data won't be split on chromosomes

  iced_data: False  # If set to true, use balanced matrix files by iterative correction from Hi-C Pro (iced) instead of raw matrix files (raw)
  interaction_type: mixed  # Type of interactions to consider (inter, intra, mixed). Mixed will process all interactions, but will perform separate statistical testing for inter and intra interactions.
  intra_resolutions: 1000000, 500000  # Resolution in base pairs (e.g., 1000000 for 1Mb) for data to be processed (if empty, process all resolutions)
  inter_resolutions: 1000000 # Resolutions to consider for interchromosomal data (if empty, process all resolutions)
  use_hicpro_bias_files: True # If true, use bias files from HiC-Pro for statistical testing


  # Filtering settings
  filter_blacklist: True  # If true, filter out interactions in blacklist regions (blacklist file path)
  filter_cytobands: True  # If true, filter out interactions in cytoband regions (cytobands file path)
  remove_chromosomes: ["chr2", "chrM", "chrY", "chrX"] # List of strings of chromosomes to be omitted from pipeline. Empty list means no chromosomes are selected.
  select_chromosomes: [] # List of strings of chromosome(s) to include in pipeline, all chromosomes not selected are omitted. Empty list means no speciic chromosomes are selected.

  min_interaction_range: 100000 # Minimum interaction threshold (genomic distance in bp) to consider. Leave empty to disable.

# Statistical settings
  use_bias_from_hicpro: True
  calculate_bias: False  # Calculate bias internally, without the use of external bias files
  kr_normalization: False
  ice_normalization: False


  # Statistical settings
  fdr_threshold: 0.05   # False Discovery Rate threshold for adjusting p-values
  metabin_occupancy: 100  # Target interaction count for equal occupancy bins for metabinning

  no_termination: True

# Add rest of the options later on (log fold, NCHG stuff, chromosomes etc)
